# AlemX AI Support — Demo Report
### AI-Powered Chatbot Inside the AlemX Messenger
**Prepared for:** Project Owner  
**Date:** April 21, 2026  
**Version:** 1.0.0  
**Status:** Live & Deployed

---

## Executive Summary

AlemX AI Support is a production-grade, AI-powered chatbot built directly inside the AlemX messenger experience — purpose-built for [AlemX](https://www.alemx.com), the next-generation Web3 social platform powered by the Proof-of-Attention (PoA) protocol.

AlemX users open the messenger and instantly chat with an AI support assistant that knows everything about the AlemX platform. No waiting for a support agent. No searching through documentation. The assistant handles questions across the full product suite — from PoA protocol and $Alem token to Visa card activation, KYC verification, and city event dates — 24/7, in any language.

Beyond the chat experience, every conversation is automatically analyzed in the background — sentiment, intent, topic, complaints, feature requests — and that intelligence surfaces in a real-time analytics dashboard giving the AlemX team instant visibility into what users are struggling with, what they want, and how they feel about the product.

The platform is fully deployed, live on Railway (backend), Vercel (web), iOS, and Android, and ready for demonstration.

## What the Product Does

AlemX users open the messenger and chat with an AI support assistant that knows everything about AlemX's platform. The assistant handles questions across the full product — from PoA protocol and $Alem token to Visa card activation, city event dates, and DApp connectivity — always escalating to `hello@alemx.com` when a human touch is needed.

Every message is automatically tagged in the background — sentiment, intent, topic, complaints, feature requests — and all of that intelligence surfaces in a real-time analytics dashboard available to the AlemX product and support teams.

The result: support that scales with zero human agents, and product insights that used to require manual ticket review.

## AI Assistant — What It Knows

The assistant is fully briefed on AlemX's complete product suite. It handles:

| Topic | What It Can Help With |
|---|---|
| **Paid Attention Marketplace** | PoA protocol, setting message/call prices, earning from posts and replies, inbox monetization |
| **Founding Creator Program** | Eligibility (first 1,000 users), lifetime badge, double income, how to apply at alemx.com |
| **$Alem Token** | Token utility, pre-listing price, vesting schedule, Tier 1/2 exchange listings, SocialFi positioning |
| **AlemX Visa Card** | Physical/virtual card, activation steps, declined transactions, spending limits |
| **KYC Verification** | Document requirements, rejection reasons, re-submission, KYC reuse across partner banks |
| **Integrated Trading & Payments** | Stocks/crypto/token trading, failed trades, region restrictions, seamless checkout |
| **Peer-to-Peer Network** | Instant transfers via @handle or QR code, memos, recurring payments |
| **Borderless Payments** | Cross-border transfers, live exchange rates, near-instant settlement, corridor timelines |
| **Partner Bank Onboarding** | Opening bank accounts, KYC reuse, guided checklists, pending status troubleshooting |
| **Revenue Sharing** | Creator earnings splits, payout tracking, configuring percentages per content type |
| **DApp Interoperability** | WalletConnect, DeFi protocol discovery, asset movement, wallet connectivity |
| **Value Transfer on Social** | Gifting stocks/crypto/cash in posts, transferring to Web3 wallet or bank card |
| **City Events & Global Tour** | Full schedule: 15 cities across Europe, LATAM, Africa, SEA + Dubai conference Apr 27, 2027 |
| **Encrypted Messenger** | Paid messaging, pricing video calls, end-to-end encryption |
| **Security** | Never requests private keys or seed phrases — flags impersonation attempts immediately |

**Escalation:** For unresolved issues the assistant always directs users to `hello@alemx.com` and `alemx.com`.  
**Language:** Detects and responds in the same language the user writes in.

## Core Features

### 1. AI Chat Interface
- Real-time conversation with an AlemX-configured AI support assistant
- Supports **Claude (Anthropic)**, **OpenAI (GPT-4o)**, or a built-in mock provider — switchable via a single environment variable with no code changes
- Full **markdown rendering** in responses: bold, italic, bullet lists, numbered steps, headings, code snippets, blockquotes, horizontal rules
- Typing indicator while AI is generating a response
- Conversation history persists across sessions
- **Suggested prompts** on empty state — 6 AlemX-specific questions to guide new users
- **12 quick topic chips** on the conversations screen covering all major AlemX features
- "Start New Conversation" always creates a truly fresh thread (never reopens previous session)
- Enter key sends message (mobile-optimised)

### 2. Conversation Management
- Full conversation history per user with search by content
- Relative timestamps ("5m ago", "2d ago")
- Hero banner: AI avatar with live green online dot, "Available 24/7" status badge
- Visual conversation list with message counts and AI avatar
- Multi-user support: 5 independent test user slots with persistent storage

### 3. Real-Time Analytics Dashboard
The analytics screen gives the AlemX product team a live view of support health:

| Metric | Description |
|---|---|
| Total Messages | Volume across the selected time window |
| Active Users | Unique users who sent messages |
| Returning Users | Users with more than one conversation |
| Complaints | Auto-flagged negative support requests |
| Feature Requests | Auto-detected product suggestions |
| Escalations | Conversations automatically flagged for team review |
| Avg Sentiment | Aggregated emotional tone score (-1 to +1) |
| Avg AI Latency | Response time of the AI provider in ms |

**Visual breakdowns:**
- Daily message volume line chart (7 / 14 / 30 / 90 day windows)
- Top topics horizontal bar chart with colour coding
- Sentiment breakdown (positive / neutral / negative) with progress bars
- Intent breakdown (complaint / feature request / question / support / general)
- Peak activity hours chart — 24-hour bar view of when users are most active
- User language breakdown — detects which languages users write in
- Recent complaints feed — last 20 with full message content and topic badges

**Demo mode:** Pre-loaded mock data for presentations without a live backend connection

### 4. Background Intelligence Pipeline
Every user message is automatically processed through five analysis algorithms — completely invisible to the user, non-blocking to the AI response:

- **Sentiment Analysis** — scores each message -1 to +1, classifies as positive / neutral / negative. Negative signals weighted 1.5× heavier.
- **Topic Extraction** — tags messages across **16 AlemX-specific topic buckets**: attention marketplace, $alem token, KYC, trading, P2P transfers, borderless payments, partner banks, revenue sharing, DApp/wallet, Visa card, city events, value transfer, messenger, social, onboarding, performance
- **Intent Classification** — detects complaint, feature request, question, support request, or general inquiry
- **Keyword Extraction** — pulls the 8 most meaningful non-stopword tokens per message
- **Language Detection** — identifies the user's language from the message text (supports English, Spanish, French, German, Portuguese, Russian, Arabic, Chinese, Japanese, Korean)

Results stored per message and rolled up into live aggregates atomically — no data races, no double-counts. Conversations containing complaints are automatically flagged in the escalation tracker.

```

### Key Architectural Decisions

**Non-blocking analytics:** The analysis pipeline runs via `setImmediate` — the AI response is returned to the user immediately, analytics happen in the background. Users never wait for tagging.

**Provider abstraction:** The AI provider is a single `chat()` function. Switching from OpenAI to Claude to mock requires only one environment variable — no code changes, no redeployment.

**Atomic topic upserts:** Topic summary updates use PostgreSQL `INSERT ... ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE` — no race conditions when multiple messages arrive simultaneously about the same topic.

**Environment-aware API URLs:** The mobile app uses `process.env.NODE_ENV` to automatically switch between localhost (development) and the Railway URL (production). Vercel correctly sets `NODE_ENV=production` at build time.

**Persistent database:** Data lives in PostgreSQL on Railway and survives all redeployments. Migrations run automatically on every server startup before Express binds.

**Force-new conversations:** A `forceNew` flag sent from the client ensures "Start New Conversation" always inserts a fresh DB row, never re-opening the most recent session.

**Trust proxy:** `app.set('trust proxy', 1)` configured for Railway's load balancer — required for rate limiting to work correctly behind the proxy.
